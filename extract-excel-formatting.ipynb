    "\n",

    "(This Excel file was downloaded from: https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data [Table 14])\n",
    "\n",
    "While this example is simple and could be easily handled during data cleaning, one can easily imagine more complex scenarios in which the nesting structure isn't as obvious (e.g., there are more than two unique strings - male and female - being nested, identical strings existing at multiple levels of the nesting structure, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise was to create a function that:\n",
    "1. Extracts information about indentation from an Excel file (Which cells are indented? How much are they indented?)\n",
    "2. Returns that information in a matrix whose structure mimics the original Excel file (i.e., if the Excel file contained 100 rows and 5 columns of formatted data, the function should return a 100x5 matrix of numbers where 0 = No indentation, 1 = first level of indentation, 2 = second level of indentation, and so on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this is my first time using Python to problem-solve, so it serves as a useful learning exercise. I make no claims that this code adheres to any sort of \"best practices\" - however, one of the easiest ways for me to learn is to dive right in and figure out what I <b>don't</b> know. A list of questions that this exercised raised for me will be included at the end of the notebook."
